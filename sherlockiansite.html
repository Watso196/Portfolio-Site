				<p>When Chris Redmond found that he could no longer manage the Sherlockian.net directory,
				he handed the project to the Writing, Information, and Digital Experience (WIDE) department
				at Michigan State University. From there, WIDE hired a team to manage the redesign and implementation
				of the site.</p>

				<p>When I came onto the team, the site had over 300 broken links, and it was my responsibility to fix them.
				After the list of links was combed over and fixed, WIDE set out to begin moving the static Sherlockian site to a Wordpress site.</p>

				<p>The team began the process of selecting and integrating a Wordpress template, which now hosts all 1500+ links on the site, and approximately 300 pages. Our initial challenge was finding themes which were text- and list-based, which supports the format of the directory, and made the transfer of content seamless. We decided upon a template that was built for directory-style sites, and used a page builder to implement templating of page design so that we could keep content consistent.</p>

				<p>I helped select an appropriate template, the page builder we now use, and design the information architecture  of the new site, while also curating and continuing to update the live, static site. I also worked with our website designer to design the page layouts based on the content we had, and to make changes to the Wordpress them  we're using so that it fits the needs of the Sherlockian fan base, which other members of our team communicated with and studied extensively throughout the process.</p>

				<p>Through this process I also communicated closely with Sherlockian groups and our stakeholders to gather background about the fan base and feedback about the designs and layouts that we chose, while building our designs in a testing environment and then sharing them with select Sherlockians to gather feedback about the site.</p>

				<p>The biggest reason that we chose Wordpress is because we also brought on content curators for each section of the site to update and select content for our intial release and also moving forward. Because WIDE doesn't have enough professionals invested in the Sherlockian fan base, we decided to use Wordpress to give content curators access to our site so that members of the community can update the directory for said community.</p>

				<p>Currently the new site is live, and our content curators and team are working on a secondary release scheduled before my graduation from MSU. Further down the line, the content and site features will be in the hands of the curators as the content and web team at WIDE pulls away and allows the community to do its due diligence.</p>
