				<p>The Michigan Electric Cooperative Association (MECA) is the legislative and communicative
				helper to the electric cooperatives across Michigan. The organization produces legal
				documents, member campaigns, and a magazine to help update and stay in touch with
				cooperative members across the state. It also manages several websites, some of which
				are for cooperatives, and others for different groups within the state's cooperative
				community.</p>
				<p>One such site was MI Co-op Kitchen, a recipe website which allows users to submit
				their recipes to the state-wide magazine without mailing in a recipe submission, as
				was previously the process.</p>
				<p>When I began working at MECA, one of the first projects I was asked to take over
				was the management of the MI Co-op Kitchen Wordpress site. I'll admit that this was a
				new experience for me, as I had never worked with Wordpress before, and had just begun
				learning about web authoring.</p>
				<p>Over the course of my internship with MECA, I was able to learn not only about how
				posts, pages, and media function in Wordpress, but also about creating portfolio pieces,
				widgets, and using plugins. This knowledge influenced the my successful management of
				the MI Co-op Kitchen site, and allowed me to make small but effective changes and updates
				which impressed the board that my supervisor ultimately presented the project to.</p>
				<p>Although the site is now in different hands, many of my contributions, such as the
				design of the revolution sliders and the user experience of the sign up page, are still
				online today.</p>
