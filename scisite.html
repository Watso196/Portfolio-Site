				<p>As the website designer for SCI Journal, upon being brought onto the team I was 
				tasked with repairing broken or non-user friendly parts of the SCI site.</p>
				<p>Upon doing some user testing, we found that new visitors to the SCI site didn’t 
				know what the site was for, and were confused by the categories they saw in the navigation 
				bar. They were also put off by the broken links, overlapping containers, and broken 
				images they encountered across pages. In order to fix this problem, I began redesigning 
				the SCI homepage and navigation bar to better communicate our purpose to our users.</p>
				<p>The  first change was to fix the broken social media images on the site by replacing 
				them with images I would create and put on the site myself, making the images more sustainable. 
				I also moved them from the header of the page to the footer due to confusion as to 
				whether users were supposed to immediately visit the social media pages before looking 
				at the content of the Journal’s website. This also made room in the header for a tagline 
				which would better describe the website to new users.</p>
				<p>The second major change was to move the navigation bar above the image slideshow 
				on the site, so as not to interfere with the viewing of the slideshow. In moving the 
				navigation bar I also changed the article pages from “activisim, community, creative, 
				editorial” to “environment, health, psychology” in order to give users a better picture 
				of what kinds of articles our site contained.</p>
				<p>Although not yet implemented, user testing with the mockups that I’ve created have 
				proven to be much more user friendly and accessible than the site was before.</p>
